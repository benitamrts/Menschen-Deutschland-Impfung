Telegram chats by so-called "Querdenker" have attracted a lot of attention with the Corona pandemic. Almost hundreds of posts and messages are shared daily, pretending to know the real truth about the Corona pandemic as "alternative media" The use of right-wing ideologies and spreading of anti-semitism is clearly visible in the chats. Populist supporters of conspiracy myths find so-called resonance spaces in social media.
According to a study by MDR, 55% of social network users are not sure whether they can distinguish between fake and true information. Social and behavioral research shows that people tend to seek confirmatory information. Social media reinforces this mechanism by having algorithms suggest matching posts.3 Similarly in Telegram groups, where links to additional chats or external websites are shared that share a similar opinion. This inhibits a pluralistic diversity of opinion and reinforces a one-sided opinion. In addition to the influence of social networks, the current social context is also responsible for the rise of right-wing populism.

The last 10,000 messages from the chats of Attila Hildmann, Xavier Naidoo and Michael Wendler (as of November 24, 2021) serve as input for the computer-generated book. The program indicates which words occur most frequently. In addition, a selection of these words was made and the sentences in which they occur were filtered out. The initial assumption that these sentences often contain conspiracy myths and polarizing statements was confirmed. These sentences were added ten times to the collected messages to strengthen the source text. The basis of the program is a Markov generator, which randomly reassembles the individual words. Through the reassemblies a text is created, which is reminiscent of nonsense poetry, but at the same time is highly charged in terms of content. The absurdity of the conspiracy myths is thus taken to the extreme.
